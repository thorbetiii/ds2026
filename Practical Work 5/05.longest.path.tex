\section{Introduction}
This labwork implements a MapReduce-based project designed to find the longest file path within a provided dataset. This simulation mimics the processing of a large-scale file system index, similar to the output of a \texttt{find /} command, by distributing the computational load across multiple parallel processes.

\section{Mapper and Reducer Design}
The system utilizes a distributed approach where the task of string length comparison is parallelized across multiple MPI ranks to ensure efficiency.


\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Mapper:} Each rank processes a specific chunk of the total path list. It performs a local comparison to identify the longest string (by character count) within its assigned subset.
    \item \textbf{Reducer:} The master process (Rank 0) gathers the "champions" (the longest path from each mapper) and performs a final reduction step to determine the global longest path.
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation}
I implemented this system using \texttt{mpi4py} on a Windows environment. For realistic testing, I used a set of local absolute paths from my project directory.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python, basicstyle=\small, frame=single, breaklines=true]
# Data sample used for testing
data = [
    "C:/Users/Admin/Documents/usth/b3/distributed_system/ds2026/Practical Work 1/server.py",
    "C:/Users/Admin/Documents/usth/b3/distributed_system/ds2026/Practical Work 2/RPC/client.py",
    "C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts",
    "C:/Program Files/Python310/python.exe",
    "C:/Users/Admin/AppData/Local/MiKTeX/miktex/log/latexmk.log"
]

# Mapper: Local max calculation
local_longest = max(my_paths, key=len)

# Reducer: Global max selection
final_winner = max(all_candidates, key=len)
\end{lstlisting}

\section{Verification}
The system was executed with 4 parallel processes. The following screenshot demonstrates the successful identification of the longest path and its character count.
